Justification for using atmospheric reanalysis data from Bin Guan (https://ucla.app.box.com/v/ARcatalog/folder/16460775063):

Eiras-Barca et al. (2018) wanted to develop system for prediction of flood events (FEs) in Europe by using ARs and weather types (WTs).They used Bin Guan's data for the ARs and used flood events in coastal NW Spain. First, the authors looked at the relationship between ARs and FEs under different WTs.Then, they look at how their study can facilitate predicting FEs.

Hunning et al. (2019) use Bin Guan's AR reanalysis to see if it is a good predictor of snowfall in the Sierra mountains. Available here: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2018GL080783
